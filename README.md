# 2021 Spring - Data Science for Biology and Medicine (LIFS 4320 & BIEN 3320)

## Introduction

This is data page for RNA sequencing data and the reference genome you may use in BIEN 3320 & LIFS 4320. 

## Description

### `RNAseq` folder

- Folder for RNAseq data you may use.

- e.g. `P1.primary.RNA.1.fastq.gz` means the compressed fastq RNA sequencing for the primary tumor in patient No.1, with read flag 1

- e.g. `P1.recurrent.RNA.2.fastq.gz` means the compressed fastq RNA sequencing for the recurrent tumor in patient No.1, with read flag 2

### `refGeno` folder

- Folder for reference genomes you may use.

- e.g. `chr21.hg37/hg38.fa` are the fasta files of reference genome of hg37/hg38 in chr21

- e.g. `chr21.hg37/hg38.gtf` are GTF files for hg37/hg38 in chr21

## How to use

You can try `git clone` and clone to your own folder.
